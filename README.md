# Photo Sharing

A wedding photo sharing app built with Next.js. Guests can browse galleries, upload photos, and leave likes and comments without logging in. Admins manage events, albums, and media through a protected dashboard.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- SQLite (default, no extra setup), MySQL 8+, or PostgreSQL 14+

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

Copy the example below into a `.env.local` file and fill in the values:

```bash
# Admin credentials (required)
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme

# NextAuth (required)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate-a-random-secret-here   # e.g. openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Database — SQLite (default, no extra config needed)
DB_BACKEND=sqlite
DATABASE_PATH=./data/wedding.db

# Database — MySQL (set DB_BACKEND=mysql and fill these in)
# DB_BACKEND=mysql
# DB_HOST=localhost
# DB_PORT=3306
# DB_USER=wedding
# DB_PASSWORD=secret
# DB_NAME=wedding

# Database — PostgreSQL (set DB_BACKEND=postgres and fill these in)
# DB_BACKEND=postgres
# DB_HOST=localhost
# DB_PORT=5432
# DB_USER=wedding
# DB_PASSWORD=secret
# DB_NAME=wedding

# Storage
UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads
STORAGE_BACKEND=disk
```

The database file (SQLite) and upload directory are created automatically on first run. Tables are created and migrated on startup for both backends.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The first time the server starts it seeds an admin user from `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Sign in at `/admin`.

## Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Make sure `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set to your public URL in production.

## Database backends

| Backend            | Driver           | Default port | When to use                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `sqlite` (default) | `better-sqlite3` | —            | Single-server deployments, easy setup            |
| `mysql`            | `mysql2`         | 3306         | Multi-instance or managed MySQL deployments      |
| `postgres`         | `pg`             | 5432         | Multi-instance or managed PostgreSQL deployments |

Switch backends by setting `DB_BACKEND` in your environment. All three use the same schema — tables are created automatically on first run.

## Environment variables

```

## Admin setup

After signing in at `/admin`, use the dashboard to:

1. Create an **event** with a URL slug (e.g. `smith-jones-2025`)
2. Optionally add **albums** to organise uploads
3. Share the public gallery URL (`/<slug>`) and upload URL (`/<slug>/upload`) with guests

Additional admin and event-manager accounts can be created from the Users section of the dashboard.
